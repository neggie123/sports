                <img src="img/LeBron James 112023_1.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>Through the first 14 games of the Lakers' season, James has averaged 26.4 points, 8.2 rebounds and 6.5 assists on a sterling 58.6 percent from the field and 39.7 percent from 3. Those are far from empty stats â€” he's one of the most valuable players in the NBA. Per Cleaning the Glass, the Lakers play 28.4 points per 100 possessions better when he's on the floor, ranking in the 99th percentile of the league.</p>

                        <p>Jon Jansen provides a specific example. He started 50 games at right tackle for Michigan from 1995-98. He played 141 more games through a 12-year NFL career. Yet one game stands out above the rest. The mud, muck and memories from a Nov. 22, 1997, matchup against the Buckeyes still resonates for one visceral reason. </p>

                                                It tends to be an exciting affair, namely because it truly is winner-take-all. Stage points don't matter. Neither do moral victories. Whichever playoff driver finishes highest takes the Cup Series crown. Every one else? Competing for second-best.
                                                Between Ryan Blaney, Christopher Bell, William Byron and Kyle Larson, this year's championship field contains the winners of 15 different races. Sweet No. 16 could prove to be the most valuable one yet. And it all starts on Saturday with qualifying results.</p>
